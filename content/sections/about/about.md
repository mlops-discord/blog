We are a community of learners who came together to explore the world of MLOps. We come together on Discord to ask questions, share experiences, and discuss tools. As we face different problems with the use cases we each tackle, sharing knowledge helps us all grow together. This is a way for us to grow in our careers, validate our learnings, and make great connections.

For community activities, we gather every now and then to discuss ML, design systems, and have fun. We have lots planned and in the pipeline, our events have so far been:

System Design Jam Session
AMA
Chess tournament with a Grand Master
